# Binary-Search-Tree-Project
The Binary Search Tree Project was created in the Spring of 2022. The program is run through the DriverMain.java file. I developed my project using the Eclipse Java IDE. I compiled and testing my program using the Mac OS Terminal. 

To test the program, use your Command Terminal. Further instructions are provided below:
Before compiling and running the program, it is advised to change into the directory
where the program is stored (for me, it is in the eclipse-workspace directory > CS3345-Project2
folder > src folder). 
To compile and run the program on the command line: 
Enter the command "javac DriverMain.java" 
On the next line, enter the command "java DriverMain <input file name> <output file name>"
To view the results, enter the command "cat <output file name>"

The program is intended to retrieve commands from the given input file and create the corresponding lazy binary search tree. Possible commands are to insert a node, delete a node, find the mininum node value, find the maximum node value, check if a value exists and is non-deleted, print the tree, and calculate the height. An example input file and corresponding output file is provided in the repository.
